# Setup
As I've mentioned before, we are going to learn MySQL and PHP for the Back-End web development. But first thing first, you must have MySQL and PHP in your device. You can go to these websites either [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [Laragon](https://laragon.org/download/index.html) to install the environment.
<br>
<br>
If it has been installed, you can check the version of PHP and MySQL by typing `php --version` and `mysql --version` in the command prompt. 
<br>
If there is something like this in the output
<br>
`PHP 7.3.0 (cli) (built: Dec  6 2018 01:54:19) ( ZTS MSVC15 (Visual C++ 2017) x64 )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.3.0-dev, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies`
<br>
and
<br>
`mysql  Ver 8.0.30 for Win64 on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)`
<br>
The tools are ready to use.
