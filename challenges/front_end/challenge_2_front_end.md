# Challenge 2: Front-End

Welcome to the front-end challenge. Hopefully you've done the front-end material and now you have an understanding of what front-end is and how we can build front-end web application.
<br>
<br>
Now it's time for you to give it a try to build web application. You have to create your own website containing all about you, like a resume. 
<br>
<br>
But of course, it's not a challenge if it doesn't have *requirements* right ? So here are all the requirements you need to meet:
<br>
- Use only native HTML, CSS, Javascript. Do not use any kind of framework like bootstrap, tailwind css, etc. Except javascript library that will help you when writing javascript codes (you should ask the mentors first if you want to use javascript library).
- Interactive things such as page changes, scroll to the top, contact page, and animations.
- To do this challenge, you have to create a repository called `{your_username}.github.io` in your github account first
- Once you have done this challenge, you have to give your github repository link in the prochef academy discord channel so the mentors can see it and give a score based on what you have done
- You can follow tutorials to create the personal website, and follow all the code there but please add something that will make it unique to yourself
- After you've done the challenge, please add your website link to the README.md below your name, just like the mentors

GLHF!!
